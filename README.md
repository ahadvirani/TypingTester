# TypingTester


Brief Description: This program outputs a prompt for the user to type as fast as they can. Only five words are output
at a time in order to keep the terminal free of clutter. The goal for the user is to try to match the shown output,
if they match a word correctly they receive points towards their words per minute(WPM). This is saved on a local
scoreboard. Scoreboards and stories are written to and taken in as .txt files.
